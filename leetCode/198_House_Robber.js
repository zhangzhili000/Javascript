题目：
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.




解决方案：（打败95.43%）（仅需要考虑，当前户偷还是不偷。如果当前户偷，最大值是前一户不偷+当前户的值。如果当前户不偷，最大值是前一户偷和不偷的最大值。）

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var rob = function(nums) {
    let max = 0;
    let pre = 0;
    nums.map((val)=>{
        let tmp = max;
        max = Math.max(max, pre+val);//max表示当前户不偷。pre表示前一户不偷的最大值。
        pre = tmp;//pre表示当前户不偷的最大值。
    })
    return max;    
};
